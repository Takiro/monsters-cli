# monsters-cli
Small monster battle game in command line for young interns to hack on.

## Purpose
This is an example program of a very simple monster battle game I made for interns of our company, so they have something to hack on after learning the basics in C#.  
It's for interns of school's work experience programs, they are often only at the company for two to four weeks,
not enough time to give them something complex or actual work,
especially since they usually have zero coding knowledge, and are in grade 8 or 9.

## What to do for interns?
The code has deliberate bugs and also some weird implementation choices for interns to find and fix. Also plenty of room to extend it with more features.
I already used this example as exercise for interns for a few years before uploading it. Sometimes they had to reimplement it with WPF or just change a few things,
depending on their skill and how fast they leaned the basics before staring this.
